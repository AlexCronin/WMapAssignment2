Web Mapping Assignment 2

An Android App that shows points of interest on a map such as Historical monuments, Amenities and so on. 
I used Django framework to create the back-end application. I used Amazons Relational Database Service to manage the data for these ‘points of interest’. 
For the backend of the project, I gained some experience using docker. I deployed my app to a Docker container and hosted it using Digital Ocean.
